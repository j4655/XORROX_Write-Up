# XORROX_Write-Up
Files related to the XORROX_Write-Up I created, detailing a walkthrough of the XORROX challenge from NahamCon 2022.

jcn_xorrox.py: This is a slightly modified version of xorrox.py, but it has WAY MORE COMMENTS than the original version, it is much more helpful. The only real modifications are in the file names being read and written to because I was using it for testing.

output.txt: This is the original output file that contains the "enc" and "xorrox" arrays and their values.

xorrox.py: This is the original file given during the challenge that contains the code used to generate the output file. The only alterations made from its original state are added comments for code clarity.

unxorrox.py: This is the script that I wrote to derive the key values and obtain the flag for the challenge.

XORROX_Write_Up.pdf: This is the write-up document for the XORROX challenge, in case you didn't get to this repo from this document.
